											<p>
												An Embroidered Patch is a piece of artwork created thru an
												embroidery machine using materials such as cotton twill and
												different colour threads. It conveys a theme, event or logo
												that commemorates the users’ message.<br /> Embroidered
												emblems and patches are a great way to put your design or
												insignia on a garment without applying the decoration
												directly to the garment. These emblems &#038; patches are
												generally produced on a heavy twill fabric with a smooth
												texture.
											</p>
											<p>In most cases a portion of the underlying twill
												becomes the background for the design, and a variety of
												thread colors make up the details of the design. There is a
												decorative stitch that overlays the edge of the twill fabric
												to make your custom embroidered emblem.</p>
											<p>Embroidered emblems and custom patches are commonly
												produced for outerwear, clothing and accessories. They work
												great for uniforms, caps, jackets and golf shirts when you
												want maximum recognition and exposure. We use the highest
												quality fabrics and threads to make your embroidered emblems
												and patches.</p>

											<p>Once a digital mock-up is done our digitizers will
												create a DST file. DST is a file format which embroidery
												machines use to translate a design into an actual
												embroidered patch.</p>
											<p>Digitizing is the indispensable foundation of any
												embroidered design. In essence, digitizing is the
												sophisticated process of converting text or a printed design
												into an embroidery format. The output of this conversion is
												a set of instructions that directs the embroidery machine to
												know what thread color to sew and where to place each
												stitch, culminating in a thread based mirror image of the
												original.</p>
											<p>The factory will use the mockup as a guide for colors,
												special options and other instructions. They will feed the
												dst file to the embroidery machine and start with
												production.</p>
											<p>Digitizing Considerations: Small elements such as tiny
												graphics or very small lettering may retain their detail in
												printing, however they do not always embroider well and may
												need to be either enlarged or removed completely from the
												design. For best embroidery results, avoid miniature
												graphics and text smaller than .25 inch. Refer to Patch
												Design Guideline Document for more technical information
												about designing for patches.</p>
											<p>Fact: A sew-out is a replica of the finished design
												and is provided to customer for approval before proceeding

															<p>
																An Embroidered Patch is a piece of artwork created thru
																an embroidery machine using materials such as cotton
																twill and different colour threads. It conveys a theme,
																event or logo that commemorates the users’ message.<br />
																Embroidered emblems and patches are a great way to put
																your design or insignia on a garment without applying
																the decoration directly to the garment. These emblems
																&#038; patches are generally produced on a heavy twill
																fabric with a smooth texture.
															</p>
															<p>In most cases a portion of the underlying twill
																becomes the background for the design, and a variety of
																thread colors make up the details of the design. There
																is a decorative stitch that overlays the edge of the
																twill fabric to make your custom embroidered emblem.</p>
															<p>Embroidered emblems and custom patches are
																commonly produced for outerwear, clothing and
																accessories. They work great for uniforms, caps, jackets
																and golf shirts when you want maximum recognition and
																exposure. We use the highest quality fabrics and threads
																to make your embroidered emblems and patches.</p>

															<p>Once a digital mock-up is done our digitizers will
																create a DST file. DST is a file format which embroidery
																machines use to translate a design into an actual
																embroidered patch.</p>
															<p>Digitizing is the indispensable foundation of any
																embroidered design. In essence, digitizing is the
																sophisticated process of converting text or a printed
																design into an embroidery format. The output of this
																conversion is a set of instructions that directs the
																embroidery machine to know what thread color to sew and
																where to place each stitch, culminating in a thread
																based mirror image of the original.</p>
															<p>The factory will use the mockup as a guide for
																colors, special options and other instructions. They
																will feed the dst file to the embroidery machine and
																start with production.</p>
															<p>Digitizing Considerations: Small elements such as
																tiny graphics or very small lettering may retain their
																detail in printing, however they do not always embroider
																well and may need to be either enlarged or removed
																completely from the design. For best embroidery results,
																avoid miniature graphics and text smaller than .25 inch.
																Refer to Patch Design Guideline Document for more
																technical information about designing for patches.</p>
															<p>Fact: A sew-out is a replica of the finished
																design and is provided to customer for approval before
																proceeding with the actual embroidery.</p>

															<p>Our Patches are available in various Embroidery
																Percentages. We offer customers 3 choices:</p>
															<p>1. 50% Embroidery – This means 50% or less of the
																patch surface area will be covered in embroidery. This
																method is ideal for Name patches (patches that display
																name or position of the user. E.g. “Trevor” or
																“President”). This is usually used for much simpler
																patches that displays words or numbers only.</p>
															<p>2. 75% Embroidery – This means 75% or less of the
																patch surface area will be covered in embroidery. This
																is most widely used method for our patches. Unless
																specified by the customer, our Brand Specialists usually
																note a standard order with 75% Embroidery. 75%
																embroidered patches are sometimes good for a lot of
																detail. If there is a lot of detail and the size is not
																large embroidery on embroidery (100%) can cause
																difficulty in the embroidery.</p>
															<p>3. 100% Embroidery &#8211; This method will cover
																100% of the patch surface area. No cotton twill will be
																exposed in the patch. Some customers prefer this because
																it makes the patch look more beautiful and luxurious;
																however this method is not suitable for all patch
																designs.</p>
